    <p>A lover of nature feels the fascination of the ferns though he may know little of
    their names and habits. Beholding them in their native haunts, adorning the rugged
    cliffs, gracefully fringing the water-courses, or waving their stately fronds on the
    borders of woodlands, he feels their call to a closer acquaintance. Happy would he be
    to receive instruction from a living teacher: His next preference would be the
    companionship of a good fern book. Such a help we aim to give him in this manual. If
    he will con it diligently, consulting its glossary for the meaning of terms while he
    quickens his powers of observation by studying real specimens, he may hope to learn
    the names and chief qualities of our most common ferns in a single season.</p>
    <p>Our most productive period in fern literature was between 1878, when Williamson
    published his "Ferns of Kentucky," and 1905, when Clute issued, "Our Ferns in Their
    Haunts." Between these flourished D.C. Eaton, Davenport, Waters, Dodge, Parsons,
    Eastman, Underwood, A.A. Eaton, Slosson, and others. All their works are now out of
    print except Clute's just mentioned and Mrs. Parsons' "How to Know the Ferns." Both
    of these are valuable handbooks and amply illustrated. Clute's is larger, more
    scholarly, and more inclusive of rare species, with an illustrated key to the genera;
    while Mrs. Parsons' is more simple and popular, with a naive charm that creates for
    it a constant demand.</p>
    <p>We trust there is room also for this unpretentious, but progressive, handbook,
    designed to stimulate interest in the ferns and to aid the average student in
    learning their names and meaning. Its geographical limits include the northeastern
    states and Canada. Its nomenclature follows in the main the seventh edition of Gray's
    Manual, while the emendations set forth in <i>Rhodora</i>, of October, 1919, and also
    a few terms of later adoption are embodied, either as synonyms or substitutes for the
    more familiar Latin names of the Manual, and are indicated by a different type. In
    every case the student has before him both the older and the more recent terms from
    which to choose. However, since the book is written primarily for lovers of Nature,
    many of whom are unfamiliar with scientific terms, the common English names are
    everywhere given prominence, and strange to say are less subject to change and
    controversy than the Latin. There is no doubt what species is meant when one speaks
    of the Christmas fern, the ostrich fern, the long beech fern, the interrupted fern,
    etc. The use of the common names will lead to the knowledge and enjoyment of the
    scientific terms.</p>
    <p>A friend unfamiliar with Latin has asked for pointers to aid in pronouncing the
    scientific names of ferns. Following Gray, Wood, and others we have marked each
    accented syllable with either the grave (`) or acute (&acute;) accent, the former showing
    that the vowel over which it stands has its long sound, while the latter indicates
    the short or modified sound. Let it be remembered that any syllable with either of
    these marks over it is the accented syllable, whose sound will be long or short
    according to the slant of the mark.</p>
    <p>We have appropriated from many sources such material as suited our purpose. Our
    interest in ferns dates back to our college days at Amherst, when we collected our
    first specimens in a rough, bushy swamp in Hadley. We found here a fine colony of the
    climbing fern (<i>Lygodium</i>). We recall the slender fronds climbing over the low
    bushes, unique twiners, charming, indeed, in their native habitat. We have since
    collected and studied specimens of nearly every New England fern, and have carefully
    examined most of the other species mentioned in this book. By courtesy of the
    librarian, Mr. William P. Rich, we have made large use of the famous Davenport
    herbarium in the Massachusetts Horticultural library, and through the kindness of the
    daughter, Miss Mary E. Davenport, we have freely consulted the larger unmounted
    collection of ferns at the Davenport homestead, at Medford,[1] finding here a very
    large and fine assortment of <i>Botrychiums</i>, including a real <i>B. ternatum</i>
    from Japan.</p>
    <h5>[Footnote 1: Recently donated to the Gray Herbarium.]</h5>
    <p>For numerous facts and suggestions we are indebted to the twenty volumes of the
    <i>Fern Bulletin</i>, and also to its able editor, Mr. Willard N. Clute. To him we
    are greatly obligated for the use of photographs and plates, and especially for
    helpful counsel on many items. We appreciate the helpfulness of the <i>American Fern
    Journal</i> and its obliging editor, Mr. E.J. Winslow. To our friend, Mr. C.H.
    Knowlton, our thanks are due for the revision of the checklist and for much helpful
    advice, and we are grateful to Mr. S.N.F. Sanford, of the Boston Society of Natural
    History, for numerous courtesies; but more especially to Mr. C.A. Weatherby for his
    expert and helpful inspection of the entire manuscript.</p>
    <p>The illustrations have been carefully selected; many of them from original
    negatives bequeathed to the author by his friend, Henry Lincoln Clapp, pioneer and
    chief promoter of school gardens in America. Some have been photographed from the
    author's herbarium, and from living ferns. A few are from the choice herbarium of Mr.
    George E. Davenport, and also a few reprints have been made from fern books, for
    which due credit is given. The Scott's spleenwort, on the dedication page, is
    reprinted from Clute's "Our Ferns in Their Haunts."</p>

    <p>Thoreau tells us, "Nature made a fern for pure leaves." Fern leaves are in the
    highest order of cryptogams. Like those of flowering plants they are reinforced by
    woody fibres running through their stems, keeping them erect while permitting
    graceful curves. Their exquisite symmetry of form, their frequent finely cut borders,
    and their rich shades of green combine to make them objects of rare beauty; while
    their unique vernation and method of fruiting along with their wonderful mystery of
    reproduction invest them with marked scientific interest affording stimulus and
    culture to the thoughtful mind. By peculiar enchantments these charming plants allure
    the ardent Nature-lover to observe their haunts and habits.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <center>
<pre>
  "Oh, then most gracefully they wave
  In the forest, like a sea,
  And dear as they are beautiful
  Are these fern leaves to me."
</pre>
    </center>
    <p>As a rule the larger and coarser ferns grow in moist, shady situations, as swamps,
    ravines, and damp woods; while the smaller ones are more apt to be found along
    mountain ranges in some dry and even exposed locality. A tiny crevice in some high
    cliff is not infrequently chosen by these fascinating little plants, which protect
    themselves from drought by assuming a mantle of light wool, or of hair and chaff,
    with, perhaps, a covering of white powder as in some cloak ferns--thus keeping a
    layer of moist air next to the surface of the leaf, and checking transpiration.</p>
    <p>Some of the rock-loving ferns in dry places are known as "resurrection" ferns,
    reviving after their leaves have turned sere and brown. A touch of rain, and lo! they
    are green and flourishing.</p>
    <p>Ferns vary in height from the diminutive filmy fern of less than an inch to the
    vast tree ferns of the tropics, reaching a height of sixty feet or more.</p>
    <br />
    <br />

    <h4>REPRODUCTION</h4>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Ferns are propagated in various ways. A frequent method is by perennial
    rootstocks, which often creep beneath the surface, sending up, it may be, single
    fronds, as in the common bracken, or graceful leaf-crowns, as in the cinnamon fern.
    The bladder fern is propagated in part from its bulblets, while the walking leaf
    bends over to the earth and roots at the tip.</p>
    <br />
    <center>

       alt="Fern Reproduction by the Prothallium" />
      <p>[Illustration: MALE SHIELD FERN. Fern Reproduction by the Prothallium]</p>
    </center>
    <p>Ferns are also reproduced by spores, a process mysterious and marvellous as a
    fairy tale. Instead of seeds the fern produces spores, which are little one-celled
    bodies without an embryo and may be likened to buds. A spore falls upon damp soil and
    germinates, producing a small, green, shield-shaped patch much smaller than a dime,
    which is called a proth&aacute;llium (or prothallus). On its under surface delicate root
    hairs grow to give it stability and nutriment; also two sorts of reproductive organs
    known as anther&iacute;dia and archeg&ograve;nia, the male and female growths analogous to the
    stamens and pistils in flowers. From the former spring small, active, spiral bodies
    called &aacute;ntheroz&ograve;ids, which lash about in the moisture of the proth&aacute;llium until they
    find the archeg&ograve;nia, the cells of which are so arranged in each case as to form a
    tube around the central cell, which is called the &ograve;&ouml;sphere, or egg-cell, the point to
    be fertilized. When one of the entering &aacute;ntheroz&ograve;ids reaches this point the desired
    change is effected, and the canal of the archeg&ograve;nium closes. The empty &ograve;&ouml;sphere
    becomes the quickened &ograve;&ouml;sphore whose newly begotten plant germ unfolds normally by
    the multiplication of cells that become, in turn, root, stem, first leaf, etc., while
    the proth&aacute;llium no longer needed to sustain its offspring withers away.[1]</p>
    <h5>[Footnote 1: In the accompanying illustration, it should be remembered that the
    reproductive parts of a fern are microscopic and cannot be seen by the naked
    eye.]</h5>
    <p>Fern plants have been known to spring directly from the proth&aacute;llus by a budding
    process apart from the organs of fertilization, showing that Nature "fulfills herself
    in many ways."[2]</p>
    <h5>[Footnote 2: The scientific term for this method of reproduction is ap&oacute;gamy
    (apart from marriage). Sometimes the prothallus itself buds directly from the frond
    without spores, for which process the term ap&oacute;spory is used. (Meaning, literally,
    without spores.)]</h5>
    <br />
    <br />

    <h4>VERNATION</h4>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>All true ferns come out of the ground head foremost, coiled up like a
    watch-spring, and are designated as "fiddle-heads," or crosiers. (A real crosier is a
    bishop's staff.) Some of these odd young growths are covered with "fern wool," which
    birds often use in lining their nests. This wool usually disappears later as the
    crosier unfolds into the broad green blade. The development of plant shoots from the
    bud is called vernation (Latin, <i>ver</i> meaning spring), and this unique uncoiling
    of ferns, "circinnate vernation."</p>
    <br />
    <br />

    <h4>VEINS</h4>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>The veins of a fern are free, when, branching from the mid-vein, they do not
    connect with each other, and simple when they do not fork. When the veins intersect
    they are said to anastomose (Greek, an opening, or network), and their meshes are
    called ar&egrave;ol&aelig; or &aacute;reoles (Latin, <i>areola</i>, a little open space).</p>

          <br />
          <br />

          <p>A frond is said to be pinnate (Latin, <i>pinna</i>, a feather), when its
          primary divisions extend to the rachis, as in the Christmas fern (Fig. 1). A
          frond is bipinnate (Latin, <i>bis</i>, twice) when the lobes of the pinn&aelig;
          extend to the midvein as in the royal fern (Fig. 2). These divisions of the
          pinn&aelig; are called pinnules. When a frond is trip&iacute;nnate the last complete
          divisions are called ultimate pinnules or segments. A frond is pinn&aacute;tifid when
          its lobes extend halfway or more to the rachis or midvein as in the middle
          lobes of the pinn&aacute;tifid spleenwort (Fig. 3). The pinn&aelig; of a frond are often
          pinn&aacute;tifid when the frond itself is pinnate; and a frond may be pinnate in its
          lower part and become pinn&aacute;tifid higher up as in the pinn&aacute;tifid spleenwort just
          mentioned (Fig. 3).</p>
          <p>The divisions of a pinn&aacute;tifid leaf are called segments; of a bipinn&aacute;tifid or
          tripinn&aacute;tifid leaf, ultimate segments.</p>

    <h4>SPOR&Agrave;NGIA AND FRUIT DOTS</h4>
    <br />
    <br />

    <p>Fern spores are formed in little sacs known as spore-cases or spor&aacute;ngia (Fig. 4).
    They are usually clustered in dots or lines on the back or margin of a frond, either
    on or at the end of a small vein, or in spike-like racemes on separate stalks. Sori
    (singular <i>sorus</i>, a heap), or fruit dots may be naked as in the polypody, but
    are usually covered with a thin, delicate membrane, known as the indusium (Greek, a
    dress, or mantle). The family or genus of a fern is often determined by the shape of
    its indusium; e.g., the indusium of the woodsias is star-shaped; of the Dicksonias,
    cup-shaped; of the aspleniums, linear; of the wood ferns, kidney-shaped, etc.</p>
    <p>In many ferns the sporangia are surrounded in whole or in part by a vertical,
    elastic ring (annulus) reminding one of a small, brown worm closely coiled (Fig. 4).
    As the spores mature, the ring contracts and bursts with considerable force,
    scattering the spores. The spores of the different genera mature at different times
    from May to September. A good time to collect ferns is just before the fruiting
    season. (For times of fruiting see individual descriptions or chronological chart on
    page 220.)</p>
    <br />
    <br />

    <h4>HELPFUL HINTS</h4>
    <br />
    <br />

    <p>The following hints may be helpful to the young collector:</p>
    <a
     id="testeri"
     name="testeri"><img
     src="images/fern023.gif"
     align="right"
     alt="A good lens" /></a>
    <p>1. A good lens with needles for dissecting is very helpful in examining the sori,
    veins, glands, etc., as an accurate knowledge of any one of these items may aid in
    identifying a given specimen. Bausch and Lomb make a convenient two-bladed pocket
    glass for about two dollars.[1]</p>
    <h5>[Footnote 1: In the linen tester here figured (cost $1.50) the lens is mounted in
    a brass frame which holds it in position, enabling the dissector to use both hands. A
    tripod lens will also be found cheap and serviceable.]</h5>
    <p>[Illustration: Linen Tester]</p>
    <p>2. Do not exterminate or weaken a fern colony by taking more plants than it can
    spare. In small colonies of rare ferns take a few and leave the rest to grow. It is
    decidedly ill-bred to rob a locality of its precious plants. Pick your fern leaf down
    close to the root-stock, including a portion of that also, if it can be spared. Place
    your fronds between newspaper sheets and lay "dryers" over them (blotting paper or
    other absorbent paper). Cover with a board or slat frame, and lay on this a weight of
    several pounds, leaving it for twenty-four hours; if the specimens are not then
    cured, change the dryers. Mount the prepared specimens on white mounting sheets. The
    regulation size is 16-1/2 by 11-1/2 inches. The labels are usually 3-3/4 by 1-3/4
    inches. A sample will suggest the proper inscription.</p>

    <p>Place the label at the lower right-hand corner of the sheet, which is now ready to be
    laid in the genus cover, usually of manila paper 16-1/2 by 12 inches. It is well to
    jot down important memoranda at the time of collecting. This is the method in use at
    the Gray Herbarium in Cambridge. It can, of course, be modified to suit one's own
    taste or convenience. The young collector can begin by simply pressing his specimens
    between the leaves of a book, the older and coarser the better; and he can mount them
    in a blank book designed for the purpose, or if he has only a common blank book, he
    can cut out some of the leaves, alternately with others left in place, as is often
    done with a scrap book, that when the book is full it may not be crowded at the back.
    Or he can use sheets of blank paper of any uniform size and mount the specimens on
    these with gummed strips, and then group them, placing those of the same genus
    together. Such an extemporized herbarium, though crude, will serve for a beginning,
    while stimulating his interest, and advancing his knowledge of the ferns. Let him
    collect, press, and mount as many varieties as possible, giving the name with date
    and place of collecting, etc. Such a first attempt may be kept as a reminder of
    pleasant hours spent in learning the rudiments of a delightful study.</p>
    <p>We cannot insist too strongly upon the necessity of handling and studying the
    living plant. Every student needs to observe for himself the haunts, habits, and
    structure of real ferns. We would say to the young student, while familiarizing
    yourself with the English names of the ferns, do not neglect the scientific names,
    which often hold the key to their meaning. Repeat over and over the name of each
    genus in soliloquy and in conversation until your mind instantly associates each fern
    with its family name--"<i>Adiantum</i>," "<i>Polystichum</i>," "<i>Asplenium</i>,"
    and all the rest. Fix them in the memory for a permanent asset. With hard study and
    growing knowledge will come growing attachment. How our great expert, Mr. Davenport,
    loved the ferns! He would handle them with gentle touch, fondly stroke their leaves,
    and devoutly study their structure, as if inspired by the All-wise Interpreter.</p>

  In gentleness of heart: with gentle hand
  Touch--for there is a spirit in the woods."

    <p>As the indusium, which often determines the name of a fern, is apt in some species
    to wither early, it is important to secure for study not only a fertile frond, but
    one in as good condition as possible. For convenience the ferns may be considered in
    two classes.</p>

    <br />
    <p>In this manual our native ferns are grouped scientifically under five distinct
    families. By far the largest of these groups, and the first to be treated, is that of
    the <i>real ferns (Polypodi&agrave;ce&aelig;)</i> with sixty species and several chief varieties.
    Then follow the <i>flowering ferns (Osmund&agrave;ce&aelig;)</i> with three species; the <i>curly
    grass</i> and <i>climbing ferns (Schiz&aelig;&agrave;ce&aelig;)</i> with two species; the <i>adder's
    tongue</i> and <i>grape ferns (Ophiogloss&agrave;ce&aelig;)</i> with seven species; and the
    <i>filmy ferns (Hymenophyll&agrave;ce&aelig;)</i> with one species.</p>
    <p>Corresponding with these five families, the sporangia or spore cases of ferns have
    five quite distinct forms on which the families are founded.</p>

    <p>Fig. 1-4: Sporangia of the Five Families]</p>
    <p>1. The Fern Family proper (<i>Polypodi&agrave;ce&aelig;</i>) has the spore cases stalked and

    <p>The outlines of the young bracken resemble the little oak fern. It flourishes in
    thickets and open pastures, often with poor soil and scant shade. It is found in all
    parts of the world, and is said to be the most common of all our North American
    ferns. In a cross section of the mature stipe superstition sees "the devil's hoof"
    and "King Charles in the oak," and any one may see or think he sees the outlines of
    an oak tree. It was the bracken, or eagle fern, as some call it, which was supposed
    to bear the mysterious "fern seed," but only on midsummer eve (St. John's eve).</p>

    <p>The word brake or bracken is one of the many plant names from which some of our
    English surnames are derived, as Brack, Breck, Brackenridge, etc., and fern (meaning
    the bracken) is seen in Fern, Fearns, Fernham, Fernel, Fernside, Farnsworth, etc.
    Also, in names of places as Ferney, Ferndale, Fernwood, and others. Although the
    bracken is coarse and common, it makes a desirable background for rockeries, or other
    fern masses. The young ferns should be transplanted in early spring with as much of
    the long, running rootstock as possible.</p>

    and polished.</p>

    <h4>(1) COMMON MAIDENHAIR. <i>Adiantum pedatum</i></h4>
    <p>A graceful fern of shady glen and rocky woodland, nine to eighteen inches high,
    the black, shining stalks forked at the top into two equal, recurved branches, the

    <p>[Illustration: Fruiting Pinn&aelig; of Maidenhair]</p>
    <p>The maidenhair has a superficial resemblance to the meadow rue, which also sheds
    water, but it may be known at once by its black, shining stalks with their divisions
    all borne on one side. It is indeed a most delicate fern, known and admired by every
    one. The term maidenhair may have been suggested by the black, wiry roots growing
    from the slender rootstock, or by the dark, polished stems, or, as Clute explains it,
    "because the black roots, like hair, were supposed, according to the 'doctrine of
    signatures' to be good for falling hair, and the plant was actually used in the
    'syrup of capillaire'[A] (<i>Am. Botanist</i>, November, 1921). While the maidenhair
    is not very common, it is widely distributed, being found throughout our section,
    westward to California, and northward to the British Provinces.</p>
    <p>"Though the maidenhair has a wide range, and grows abundantly in many localities,
    it possesses a quality of aloofness which adds to its charm. Its chosen haunts are
    dim, moist hollows in the woods, or shaded hillsides sloping to the river. In such
    retreats you find the feathery fronds tremulous on their glistening stalks, and in
    their neighborhood you find, also, the very spirit of the woods."<br />

    indicated was highly esteemed as a pectoral for the relief of difficult

    <p>Var. ALEUTICUM, or Alpine Maidenhair. A beautiful northern form especially
    abundant on the high tableland of the Gasp&eacute; Peninsula, Quebec, where it is said to
    cover hundreds of acres. In the east it is often dwarfed--six to ten inches high,
    growing in tufts with stout rootstocks, having the pinnules finely toothed instead of
    rounded and the indusia often lunate, rarely twice as long as broad. (Fernald in

    <p>[Illustration: Purple Cliff Brake. <i>Pell&aelig;a atropurpurea</i>]</p>
    <p>Another name is "the winter brake," as its fronds remain green throughout the
    winter, especially in its more southern ranges. It grows on rocky ledges with a
    preference for limestone, and often in full sun. In large and mature fronds its pinn&aelig;
    are apt to be extremely irregular. While its stipes are purplish, its leaves are
    bluish-green, and its scales light-brown or yellow. Strange to say, this brake of the
    cliffs thrives in cultivation. Woolson says of it, "This fern is interesting and
    valuable. It is not only beautiful in design, but unique in color, a dark blue-green
    emphasizing all the varying tints about it--a first-class fern for indoor winter
    cultivation. It is a rapid grower, flourishing but a few feet from coal fire or
    radiator, in a north or south window. It quickly forgives neglect, and if allowed to
    dry up out of doors or indoors, recovers in due time when put in a moist atmosphere.
    It makes but one imperative demand, and that is the privilege of standing still.
    Overzealous culturists usually like to turn things around, but revolving cliffs are
    not in the natural order of things. The slender black stipes are very susceptible to
    changes of light and warped and twisted fronds result."</p>

    <h4>(3) DENSE CLIFF BRAKE</h4>
    <h4><i>Cryptogr&aacute;mma densa. Pella&egrave;a densa</i></h4>
    <p>Modern botanists are inclined to place the dense cliff brake and the slender cliff
    brake under the genus <i>Cryptogr&aacute;mma</i>, which is so nearly like <i>Pellaea</i>
    that one hesitates to choose between them. The word Cryptogr&aacute;mma means in Greek a
    <i>hidden line</i>, alluding to the line of sporangia hidden beneath the reflexed
    margin.</p>
    <p>The dense cliff brake may be described as follows:</p>
    <p>Stipes three to nine inches tall, blades one to three inches, triangular-ovate,
    pinnate at the summit, and tripinnate below. Segments linear, sharp-pointed, mostly
    fertile, having the margins entire and recurved, giving the sori the appearance of
    half-open pods. Sterile fronds sharply serrate. Stipes in dense tufts
    ("<i>densa</i>") slender, wiry, light-brown.</p>
    <p>This rare little fern is a northern species and springs from tiny crevices in
    rocks, preferring limestone. Like many other rock-loving species, it produces spores
    in abundance, having no other effective means of spreading, and its fertile fronds
    are much more numerous than the sterile ones, and begin to fruit when very small.

    <p>The parsley fern is the typical species of the genus <i>Cryptogr&aacute;mma</i>. The
    indusium is formed of the altered margin of the pinnule, at first reflexed to the

    formed of the reflexed margin of the lobes or of the whole pinnule. Veins free, but
    often obscure. Most of the ferns of this genus grow in dry, exposed situations, where
    rain is sometimes absent for weeks and months. For this reason they protect
    themselves by a covering of hairs, scales or wool, which hinders the evaporation of
    water from the plant by holding a layer of more or less saturated air near the
    surface of the frond. (In Greek the word means <i>lip flower</i>, alluding to the

    <p>[Illustration: Hairy Lip Fern]</p>
    <p>Fronds twice pinnate, lanceolate with oblong, pinn&aacute;tifid pinnules; seven to
    fifteen inches tall, slender and rough with rusty, jointed hairs. Pinn&aelig;
    triangular-ovate, usually distant, the ends of the rounded lobes reflexed and forming
    separate involucres which are pushed back by the ripening sporangia.</p>
    <p>This species like the other lip ferns is fond of rocks, springing from clefts and
    ledges. While hairy it is much less tomentose than the two following species. Unlike
    most of the rock-loving ferns this species is not partial to limestone, but grows on
    other rocks as well. It has been found as far north as New Haven, Conn., also near
    New York, and in New Jersey, Georgia, and westward to Wyoming and southward.</p>
    <h4>(3) WOOLLY LIP FERN. <i>Cheil&aacute;nthes toment&ograve;sa</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds eight to eighteen inches long, lanceolate-oblong, tripinnate. Pinn&aelig; and
    pinnules ovate-oblong, densely woolly especially beneath, with slender, whitish,
    obscurely jointed hairs. Of the ultimate segments the terminal one is twice as long
    as the others. Pinnules distant, the reflexed, narrow margin forming a continuous,
    membranous indusium. Stipe stout, dark brown, densely woolly.</p>
    <p>By donning its thick coat of wool this species is prepared to grow in the most
    exposed situations of the arid southwest. It is said to be the "rarest, tallest and
    handsomest of the lip ferns."</p>
    <p>Mountains of Virginia and Kentucky to Georgia, and west to Missouri, Texas and
    Arizona.</p>
    <h4>(4) SLENDER LIP FERN</h4>
    <h4><i>Cheil&aacute;nthes F&eacute;ei, C. lanugin&ograve;sa</i></h4>
    <p>Stipes densely tufted, slender, at first hairy, dark brown, shining. Fronds three
    to eight inches long, ovate-lanceolate, with thickish, distinctly articulated hairs,
    twice or thrice pinnate. Pinn&aelig; ovate, the lowest deltoid. Pinnules divided into
    minute, densely crowded segments, the herbaceous margin recurved and forming an
    almost continuous indusium.</p>

    <p>[Illustration: Slender Lip Fern]</p>
    <p>The slender lip fern, known also as F&eacute;e's fern, is much the smallest of the lip
    ferns, averaging, Clute tells us, "but two inches high." This is only one-third as
    tall as the woolly lip fern and need not be mistaken for it. The fronds form tangled
    mats difficult to unravel. It grows on dry rocks and cliffs--Illinois and Minnesota
    to British Columbia, and south to Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.</p>

     name="cloak">5. CLOAK FERN. <i>Nothol&agrave;ena</i></a></h4>
    <p>Small ferns with fruit-dots borne beneath the revolute margin of the pinnules, at
    first roundish, but soon confluent into a narrow band without indusium. Veins free.
    Fronds one to several times pinnate, the lower surface hairy, or tomentose or
    powdery. Includes about forty species, mostly American, but only one within our
    limits. (Greek name means <i>spurious cloak</i>, alluding to the rudimentary or
    counterfeit indusium.)</p>
    <h4>(1) POWDERY CLOAK FERN. <i>Nothol&agrave;ena dealb&agrave;ta</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds two to six inches long, triangular-ovate, acute, broadest at the base,
    tripinnate. Stalks tufted, wiry, shining, dark brown. Upper surface of the very small
    segments green, smooth, the lower densely coated with a pure, white powder; hence,
    the specific name <i>dealbata</i>, which means whitened. Sori brown at length; veins
    free.</p>
    <p>There are several species of cloak ferns, but only one within our limits. The dry,
    white powder which covers them doubtless is designed to protect them from too rapid
    evaporation of moisture, as they all inhabit dry and sunny places. This delicate
    rock-loving fern is found in the clefts of dry limestone rocks in Missouri, Kansas,
    Colorado, and southwestward.</p>

     id="chain"
     name="chain">THE CHAIN FERNS. <i>Woodwardia</i></a></h4>
    <p>Large and somewhat coarse ferns of swampy woods with pinnate or nearly two-pinnate
    fronds, and oblong or linear fruit-dots, arranged in one or more chain-like rows,
    parallel to and near the midribs. Indusium fixed by its outer margin to a veinlet and
    opening on the inner side. In our section there are two species. (Named for Thomas J.
    Woodward, an English botanist.)</p>
    <h4>(1) THE COMMON CHAIN FERN. <i>Woodwardia virg&iacute;nica</i></h4>
    <p>Sterile and fertile fronds similar in outline, two to four feet high, once
    pinnate, the pinn&aelig; deeply incised with oblong segments. Fruit-dots oblong in
    chain-like rows along the midrib both of the pinn&aelig; and the lobes, confluent when
    ripe. Veins forming narrow rows of net-like spaces (areoles) beneath the fruit-dots,
    thence free to the margin. The spores ripen in July.</p>

     src="images/fern070.jpg"
     alt="Common Chain Fern" /></a>
    <p>[Illustration: The Common Chain Fern. <i>Woodwardia virginica</i>]</p>
    <p>The sterile fronds resemble those of the cinnamon fern, but the latter grow in
    crowns, with a single frond in the center, while the fronds of the chain fern rise
    singly from the creeping rootstock, which sends them up at intervals all summer. The
    sori are borne on the backs of fertile fronds. There are usually more sterile than
    fertile blades, especially in dense shade. We have waded repeatedly through a miry
    swamp in Melrose, Mass., where the wild calla flourishes along with the blueberry and
    other swamp bushes, and have found the chain fern in several shaded spots, but every
    frond was sterile. It is said that when exposed to the sun it always faces the south.
    Swamps, Maine to Florida, especially along the Atlantic Coast, and often in company
    with the narrow-leaved species.</p>

    <h4>(2) NET-VEINED CHAIN FERN</h4>
    <h4>NARROW-LEAVED CHAIN FERN</h4>
    <h4><i>Woodwardia areol&agrave;ta. W. angustif&ograve;lia</i></h4>
    <p>Root stocks creeping and chaffy. Sterile and fertile fronds unlike; sterile ones
    nine to twelve inches tall, deltoid-ovate. Broadest at the base, with lanceolate,
    serrulate divisions united by a broad wing. Veins areolate; fertile fronds taller,
    twelve to twenty inches high with narrowly linear divisions, the areoles and
    fruit-dots in a single row each side of the secondary midrib, the latter sunk in the
    tissues.</p>
    <p>This species is less common than the Virginia fern, but they often grow near each
    other. We have collected both in the Blue Hill reservation near Boston, and both have
    been found in Hingham, Medford, and Reading, and doubtless in other towns along the
    coast. Mrs. Parsons speaks of finding them in the flat, sandy country near Buzzard's
    Bay. The net-veined species has some resemblance to the sensitive fern, but in the
    latter the spore cases are shut up in small pods formed by the contracting and
    rolling up of the lobes, whereas the chain fern bears its sori on the under side of
    long, narrow pinn&aelig;. Besides, the sterile fronds of the latter have serrulate
    segments. As in the sensitive fern there are many curious gradations between the
    fertile and sterile fronds, both in shape and fruitfulness. Waters calls them the
    "<i>obtusilob&agrave;ta</i> form."</p>

    <p>Small, evergreen ferns. Fruit-dots oblong or linear, oblique, separate when young.
    Indusium straight or rarely curved, fixed lengthwise on the upper side of a fertile
    veinlet, opening toward the midrib. Veins free. Scales of rhizome and stipes narrow,
    of firm texture and with thick-walled cells.</p>
    <h4>(1) PINN&Agrave;TIFID SPLEENWORT. <i>Asplenium pinnat&iacute;f&iacute;dum</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds four to six inches long, lanceolate, pinn&aacute;tifid or pinnate near the base,
    tapering above into a slender prolongation. Lobes roundish-ovate, or the lower pair
    acuminate. Fruit-dots irregular, numerous. Stipes tufted, two to four inches long,
    brownish beneath, green above.</p>
    <p>Although this fern, like all the small spleenworts, is heavily fruited, it is
    extremely rare. It is found as far north as Sharon, Conn., thence southward to
    Georgia, to Arkansas and Missouri. On cliffs and rocks. Resembles the walking fern,
    and its tip sometimes takes root.</p>

    <p>This small fern is a southern species half way between the maidenhair and ebony

    <p>Fronds upright, eight to eighteen inches high, linear-lanceolate, the fertile ones
    much taller, and pinnate. Pinn&aelig; scarcely an inch long, the lower ones very much
    shorter, alternate, spreading, finely serrate or incised, the base auricled. Sori
    numerous, rather near the midvein, stipe and rachis lustrous brown. ("Ebony.")</p>
    <p>This rigidly upright but graceful fern flourishes in rocky, open woods, and on
    rich, moist banks, often in the neighborhood of red cedars. Having come upon it many
    times in our rambles, we should say it was not uncommon.</p>
    <p>A lightly incised form of the pinn&aelig; has been described as var. <i>serratum</i>. A
    handsome form discovered in Vermont in 1900 by Mrs. Horton and named <i>Horton&aelig;</i>

    <p>The following species, which are often two to three feet high and grow in rich
    soil, are quite different in appearance and habits from the small rock spleenworts
    just described. Some botanists have kept them in the genus <i>Asplenium</i> because
    their sori are usually rather straight or only slightly curved, but others are
    inclined to follow the practice of the British botanists and put them into a separate
    group under <i>Ath&yacute;rium</i>. Nearly all agree that the lady fern, with its variously
    curved sori, should be placed here, and many others would place the silvery
    spleenwort in the same genus, partly because of its frequently doubled sori. In
    regard to the last member of the group, the narrow-leaved spleenwort, there is more
    doubt. The sori taken separately would place it with the <i>Aspleniums</i>, but
    considering its size, structure, habits of growth and all, it seems more closely
    allied to the two larger ferns than to the little rock species. We shall group the
    three together as the large spleenworts, or for the sake of being more definite adopt
    Clute's felicitous phrase.</p>
    <h4>THE LADY FERN AND ITS KIN</h4>
    <h4>1. THE LADY FERNS</h4>
    <p>Fronds one to three feet high, broadly lanceolate, or ovate-oblong, tapering
    towards the apex, bipinnate. Pinn&aelig; lanceolate, numerous. Pinnules oblong-lanceolate,
    cut-toothed or incised. Fruit-dots short, variously curved. Indusium delicate, often
    reniform, or shaped like a horseshoe, in some forms confluent at maturity.</p>
    <p>Widely distributed, common and varying greatly in outline. The newer nomenclature
    separates the lady fern of our section into two distinct species, which should be
    carefully studied.[A]</p>
    <h5>[Footnote A: See monograph by F.K. Butters in <i>Rhodora</i> of September,
    1917.]</h5>
    <h4>(1) THE UPLAND LADY FERN. ATH&Yacute;RIUM ANG&Uacute;STUM</h4>
    <h4><i>Aspl&egrave;nium F&igrave;lix-femina</i></h4>
    <p>The rootstock or rhizome of the Upland Lady Fern here pictured shows how the
    thick, fleshy bases of the old fronds conceal the rootstock itself. In the Lowland
    Lady Fern the rootstock is but slightly concealed by old stipe bases, and so may be
    distinguished from its sister fern.</p>
    <p>One design of such rootstocks is to store up food (mostly starch), during the
    summer to nourish the young plants as they shoot forth the next spring. The undecayed
    bases of the old stipes are also packed with starch for the same purpose.</p>

    <p>Rootstocks horizontal, quite concealed by the thick, fleshy bases of old fronds.
    Scales of the long, tufted stipes dark brown. Indusium curved, often
    horseshoe-shaped, usually toothed or fringed with fine hairs, but without glands.
    Fronds bipinnate, one to three feet high, widest near the middle.</p>
    <p>This is the common species of northern New England and the Canadian Provinces. The
    fronds differ very widely in form and a great many varieties have been pointed out,
    but the fern student, having first learned to identify the species, will gradually
    master the few leading varieties as he meets them.</p>
    <p>Those growing in warm, sunny places where the fruit-dots when mature incline to
    cover the whole back of the frond are called "sun forms." These are varieties T&Yacute;PICUM
    and EL&Agrave;TIUS, both with the pinn&aelig; obliquely ascending (including variety
    <i>angustum</i> of D.C. Eaton), but the latter has broader fronds with the pinnules
    of the sterile fronds oblong-lanceolate, somewhat acute and strongly toothed or
    pinnatifid.</p>

    <p>Var. RUB&Eacute;LLUM has the sori distinct even when mature; its pinnules stand at a wide
    angle from the rachis of the pinna and are strongly toothed or pinnatifid with obtuse
    teeth. This variety favors regions with cool summers, or dense shade in warmer
    regions. The term RUB&Eacute;LLUM alludes to the reddish stems so often seen but this sign
    alone may not determine the variety. It occurs throughout the range of the species,
    being a common New England fern. Fernald remarks that this is also a common form of
    the species in southern Nova Scotia.</p>
    <p>Among other varieties named by Butters are CONF&Eacute;RTUM, having the pinnules
    irregularly lobed and toothed; joined by a membranous wing, the lobes of the pinnules
    broad and overlapping, giving the fern a compact appearance; LACINI&Agrave;TUM with pinnules
    very irregular in size and shape, with many long, acute teeth, which project in
    various directions. "An abnormal form which looks as if it had been nibbled when
    young."</p>

    <h4>ATH&Yacute;RIUM ASPLENI&Ograve;IDES</h4>
    <p>Rootstocks creeping, not densely covered with the persistent bases of the fronds.
    Stipes about as long as the blade. Scales of the stipe very few, seldom persistent,
    rarely over 3-16 of an inch long. Fronds narrowly deltoid, lanceolate, widest near
    the base, the second pair of pinn&aelig; commonly longest. Indusia ciliate, the cilia
    (hairs) ending in glands. Spores dark, netted or wrinkled.</p>

    <p>[Illustration: Lowland Lady Fern. ATHYRIUM ASPLENIOIDES (From the Gray
    Herbarium)]</p>
    <p>The following two forms are named by Butters:</p>
    <p>F. T&Yacute;PICUM. The usual form frequent in eastern Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
    Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio, and Missouri.</p>
    <p>F. SUBTRIPINN&Agrave;TUM. An unusually large and rare form with triangular, lanceolate,
    and pinnatifid pinnules, having blunt, oblong segments. Wet situations in half shade.
    Massachusetts, West Virginia, and Virginia.</p>
    <p>Our lowland or southern lady fern flourishes in the southern states, comes up the
    Atlantic Coast until it meets the upland or northern species in Pennsylvania and
    southern New England, and their identification can hardly fail to awaken in the
    student a keen interest.</p>
    <p>Our American botanists are inclined to think that the real <i>Ath&yacute;rium
    f&igrave;lix-f&eacute;mina</i> is not to be found in the northeastern United States, but is rather
    a western species, with its habitat in California and the Rocky Mountain region and
    identical with <i>Ath&yacute;rium cyclos&ograve;rum</i>.</p>
    <p>But whatever changes may occur in the scientific name of the old <i>Ath&yacute;rium
    f&igrave;lix-f&eacute;mina</i>, the name lady fern will not change, but everywhere within our
    limits it will hold its own as a familiar term.</p>
    <p>Underwood, writing of the lady fern under the genus <i>Asplenium</i>, mentions the
    form "<i>ex&igrave;le</i>, small, starved specimens growing in very dry situations and often
    fruiting when only a few inches high." He also mentions Eaton's "<i>ang&uacute;stum</i>,"
    and alludes to the "Remaining sixty-three varieties equally unimportant that have
    been described of this species."</p>
    <p>The lady fern is common in moist woods, by walls and roadsides, and at its best is
    a truly handsome species, although, like Mrs. Parsons, we have noticed that in the
    late summer it loses much of its delicacy. "Many of its forms become disfigured and
    present a rather blotched and coarse appearance." The lady fern has inspired several
    poems, which have been quoted more or less fully in the fern books. The following
    lines are from the pen of Calder Campbell:</p>
    <p>"But not by burne in wood or dale Grows anything so fair As the palmy crest of
    emerald pale Of the lady fern when the sunbeams turn To gold her delicate hair."</p>
    <p>Referring, perhaps, to the fair colors of the unfolding crosiers revealing stipes
    of a clear wine color in striking contrast with the delicate green of the
    foliage.</p>
    <p>In identifying this fern the novice should bear in mind the tendency of the curved
    sori of youth to become straightened and even confluent with age, although such
    changes are rather unreliable. Possibly the suggestion of the poetic Davenport may be
    helpful to some that there is "An indefinable charm about the various forms of the
    lady fern, which soon enables one to know it from its peculiarly graceful motion by
    merely gently swaying a frond in the hand." Spores ripen in August.</p>
    <p>The lady fern is very easy to cultivate and when once established is apt to crowd
    aside its neighbors.</p>
    <h4>(3) SILVERY SPLEENWORT. ATH&Yacute;RIUM ACROSTICH&Ograve;IDES</h4>
    <h4><i>Aspl&egrave;nium acrostich&ograve;ides. Aspl&egrave;nium thelypter&ograve;ides</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds two to four feet tall, pinnate, tapering both ways from the middle. Pinn&aelig;
    deeply pinnatifid, linear-lanceolate, acuminate. Lobes oblong, obtuse, minutely
    toothed, each bearing two rows of oblong or linear fruit-dots. Indusium silvery when
    young.</p>

    <p>[Illustration: Silvery Spleenwort. Athyrium acrostichoides]</p>
    <p>The sterile fronds come up first and the taller, fertile ones do not appear until
    late in June. Where there are no fruit-dots the hairs on the upper surface of the
    fronds will help to distinguish it from specimens of the Marsh fern tribe, which it
    somewhat resembles. The regular rows of nearly straight, clear-cut sori of the
    fertile fronds are very attractive, and the lower ones, as well as those at the
    slender tips of the pinn&aelig;, are frequently double.</p>
    <p>Rich woods and moist, shady banks, New England to Kentucky and westward. Generally
    distributed but hardly common.</p>

    September. Not common. Mt. Toby, Mass., Berlin and Meriden, Conn., and Danville, Vt.
    Can be cultivated but should not be exposed to severe weather, as its thin and

    to Woolson, "No rockery is complete without the Hart's Tongue, the long, glossy,

    either side of the reticulated veins of the simple frond, the outer ones sometimes
    confluent at their ends, forming crooked lines (hence, the name from the Greek

    reticulated. The auricles of this species are sometimes elongated and may even take
    root.</p>
    <p>This curious and interesting fern is one of the finest for rockeries, the tips
    taking root in rock-fissures. Shaded limestone, or sometimes other rocks. Shapleigh

    <h4><i>Pol&yacute;stichum</i></h4>
    <p>These have been grouped with the wood ferns, but are now usually placed under the
    genus <i>Pol&yacute;stichum</i>, which has the sori round and covered with a circular
    indusium fixed to the frond by its depressed center. The wood ferns, on the other
    hand, have a kidney-shaped indusium attached to the fronds by the sinus.
    (<i>Pol&yacute;stichum</i> is the Greek for many rows, the sori of some species being in
    many ranks.)</p>
    <h4>(1) THE CHRISTMAS FERN</h4>
    <p><i>Pol&yacute;stichum acrostich&ograve;ides. Asp&iacute;dium acrostich&ograve;ides</i></p>
    <p>Stipes clothed with pale, brown scales. Frond rigid and evergreen, one to two feet
    long, lanceolate, pinnate. Pinn&aelig; linear-lanceolate, scythe-shaped, auricled on the
    upper side, and with bristly teeth; fertile pinn&aelig; contracted toward the top, bearing
    two rows of sori, which soon become confluent and cover the entire surface. Indusium
    orbicular, fixed by its depressed center.</p>
    <p><i>F. inc&igrave;sum</i> is a form in which the pinn&aelig; are much incised.</p>
    <p><i>F. cr&iacute;spum</i> has the edges of its pinn&aelig; crisped and ruffled. The name
    Christmas fern, due to John Robinson, of Salem, Mass., suggests its fitness for
    winter decoration. Its deep green and glossy fronds insure it a welcome at Christmas
    time. "Its mission is to cheer the winter months and enhance the beauty of the other
    ferns by contrast." In transplanting, a generous mass of earth should be included and
    its roots should not be disturbed.</p>

    <p>This handsome fern is rather common in northern New England. We have collected it
    in the Willoughby Lake region, Vt., and it is found at Mt. Mansfield, Randolph, and
    elsewhere in that state; also at Gorham, N.H., and Fernald reports it as common in
    northern Maine. It also grows in the mountains of New York and Pennsylvania, and
    westward. It was formerly thought to be a variety of the prickly shield fern (<i>P.
    acule&agrave;tum</i>), which has a very wide range and numerous varieties. The fronds remain
    green through the winter but the stipes weaken and fall over.</p>

    <p>Fronds linear-lanceolate, short-stalked and rigid, eight to fifteen inches long.

    <p>The name holly fern suggests its resemblance to holly leaves with their
    bristle-tipped teeth. The specific name lonch&igrave;tis (like a spear) refers to its sharp
    teeth. A northern species growing in rocky woods from Labrador to Alaska, and south
    to Niagara Falls, Lake Superior and westward. Its southern limits nearly coincide

     id="marsh"
     name="marsh">THE MARSH FERN TRIBE</a></h3>
    <p>Under this designation Clute has grouped three of the shield ferns, which have a
    close family resemblance, and has thus distinguished them from the wood ferns, which
    also belong to the shield fern family.</p>
    <h4>(1) THE MARSH FERN</h4>
    <h4><i>Asp&iacute;dium thel&yacute;pteris</i>. THEL&Yacute;PTERIS PAL&Uacute;STRIS</h4>
    <h4><i>Dry&oacute;pteris thel&yacute;pteris. Nephr&ograve;dium thel&yacute;pteris</i></h4>

     alt="Marsh Fern" /></a>
    <p>[Illustration: The Marsh Fern]</p>
    <p>These are all good names and each one is worthy to be chosen. <i>Asp&iacute;dium</i>,
    Greek for shield, in use for a century, adopted in all the seven editions of Gray's
    Manual, is still the most familiar and pleasing term to its friends.
    <i>Dry&oacute;pteris</i>, Greek for oak fern, has been chosen by Underwood and Britton and
    Brown and has grown in favor. <i>Nephr&ograve;dium</i>, meaning kidney-like, favored by
    Davenport, Waters and, of late, Clute, is a most fitting name. THEL&Yacute;PTERIS, meaning
    lady fern, is found to be the earliest name in use and according to rule the correct
    one.</p>
    <a
     id="marshmassi"
     name="marshmassi"><img
     src="images/fern112.jpg"
     alt="Marsh Fern, in the mass" /></a>
    <p>[Illustration: The Marsh Fern. <i>Aspidium Thelypteris</i>]</p>
    <p>Fronds pinnate, lanceolate, slightly or not at all narrowed at the base. Pinn&aelig;
    horizontal or slightly recurved, linear-lanceolate and deeply pinnatifid. Lobes
    obtuse, but appear acute when their margins are reflexed over the sori. Veins once
    forked. Indusium minute. Stipes tall, lifting the blades ten to fifteen inches above
    the mud, whence they spring.</p>
    <p>The fronds of the marsh fern are apt to be sterile in deep shade. It may be
    readily distinguished from the New York fern by its broad base, instead of tapering
    to very small pinn&aelig;; by its long stalk, lifting the blade up into the sunlight, and
    by the revolute margins of the fertile fronds, which have suggested for it the name
    of "snuff-box" fern. It is separated from the Massachusetts fern by its forked veins.
    Common in marshes and damp woodlands; Canada to Florida and westward. While the marsh
    fern loves moisture and shade it is sometimes found in dry, open fields. Miss Lilian
    A. Cole, of Union, Me., reports a colony as growing on land above the swale in which
    Twayblade and Adder's Tongue are found, "around rock heaps in open sunlight on clay
    soil, but homely and twisted," as if a former woodsy environment had been long since
    cleared away while the deserted ferns persisted.</p>
    <h4>(2) MASSACHUSETTS FERN</h4>
    <h4><i>Aspidium simul&agrave;tum</i>. THEL&Yacute;PTERIS SIMUL&Agrave;TA</h4>
    <h4><i>Dry&oacute;pteris simulata. Nephr&ograve;dium simul&agrave;tum</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds pinnate, one to three feet long, oblong-lanceolate, somewhat narrowed at
    the base. Pinn&aelig; lanceolate, deeply pinnatifid, the lower most often turned inward.
    Veins simple. Indusium glandular. Sori rather large.</p>
    <p>Resembles the marsh fern, of which it was once thought to be a variety. In some
    respects it is also like the New York fern, and is in fact intermediate between the
    two.</p>

    <p>That it is a distinct species was first pointed out by Raynal Dodge in 1880, and
    it later was named <i>simul&agrave;tum</i>&gt; by Geo. E. Davenport because of its
    similarity to a form of the lady fern. It may be identified by its thin texture and
    particularly by its simple veins. On account of its close resemblance to the marsh
    fern, Clute would call it "The lance-leaved Marsh Fern," instead of the irrelevant
    name of Massachusetts Fern. Woodland swamps usually in deep shade, New England to
    Maryland and westward. Often found growing with the marsh fern.</p>

    <h3><a
     id="beech"
     name="beech">THE BEECH FERNS</a></h3>
    <p>The beech ferns are often classed with the polypodies, because, like them, they
    have no indusium; but in other ways they are more akin to the wood ferns. Their
    stipes are not jointed to the root stock, nor are their sori at the ends of the veins
    as in the polypodies. We here place them with the wood ferns, retaining the familiar
    name <i>Pheg&oacute;pteris</i> but giving THEL&Yacute;PTERIS as a synonym. The fruit-dots are
    small, round and naked, borne on the back of the veins below the apex. Stipe
    continuous with the rootstock. Veins free. (The name <i>Pheg&oacute;pteris</i> in Greek
    means oak or beech fern.)</p>
    <h4>(1) OAK FERN</h4>
    <h4><i>Pheg&oacute;pteris dry&oacute;pteris</i>. THEL&Yacute;PTERIS DRY&Oacute;PTERIS</h4>
    <p>Fronds glabrous, broadly triangular, ternate, four to seven inches broad, the
    divisions widely spreading, each division pinnate at the base. Segments oblong,
    obtuse, entire or toothed. Fruit-dots near the margin. Rootstock slender and creeping
    from which fronds are produced all summer, in appearance like the small, ternate
    divisions of the bracken.</p>
    <p>This dainty fern has fronds of a delicate yellow-green, "the greenest of all green
    things growing." Its ternate character is shown even in the uncoiling of the fronds,
    the three round balls suggesting the sign of the pawnbroker. The parts of the oak
    fern develop with great regularity, each pinna, pinnule and lobe having another
    exactly opposite to it nearly always. In rocky woods, common northward; also in
    Virginia, Kansas and Colorado. A fine species for cultivation at the base of the
    artificial rockery.</p>

    <h4>(3) BROAD BEECH FERN</h4>
    <h4><i>Phegopteris hexagon&oacute;ptera</i></h4>
    <h4>THEL&Yacute;PTERIS HEXAGON&Oacute;PTERA</h4>
    <p>Fronds triangular, broader than long, seven to twelve inches broad, spreading more
    or less horizontally at the summit of the stipe; pubescent and often glandular
    beneath; pinn&aelig; fragrant, lanceolate, the lowest pair usually much larger than those
    above, having the segments elongated and cut into lobes. Basal segments decurrent and
    forming a many-angled wing along the main rachis. Fruit-dots small, near the
    margin.</p>
    <p>The broad beech fern is usually larger than its sister, the long beech fern, and
    extends farther south, ranging from New England to Minnesota and southward to
    Florida. It is sometimes called "six-angled polypody." According to Dodge it is most
    common in Rhode Island and Connecticut. It prefers rather dry, open woods. It is said
    to have a pleasant, ferny odor when bruised. August.</p>
    <h4>(4) LONG BEECH FERN</h4>
    <h4><i>Phegopteris polypodi&ograve;ides</i>. THEL&Yacute;PTERIS PHEG&Oacute;PTERIS</h4>
    <p>Fronds triangular, longer than broad, four to six inches long, twice pinnatifid.
    Pinn&aelig; lanceolate, acuminate, the lowest pair deflexed and standing forward; cut into
    oblong, obtuse segments. Fruit-dots near the margin.</p>
    <p>Compared with the broad beech fern this is the more northern species. While
    usually quite distinct in structure, it sometimes approaches its sister fern rather
    closely.</p>
    <p>It prefers deep woods and shaded banks. Newfoundland to Alaska and southward to
    the mountains of Virginia. July.</p>

    <h4>THEL&Yacute;PTERIS FR&Agrave;GRANS. <i>Dry&oacute;pteris fr&agrave;grans</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds four to twelve inches high, glandular-aromatic, narrowly lanceolate and
    twice pinnate or nearly so. Pinn&aelig; oblong-lanceolate, pinnate or deeply pinnatifid.
    Pinnules toothed or entire nearly covered beneath with the large, thin, imbricated
    indusia which are orbicular with a narrow sinus, having the margins ragged and
    sparingly glanduliferous. Stipe short and chaffy.</p>
    <p>The fragrant fern grows on high cliffs among the mountains of northern New
    England. It is reported from scattered stations in northern Maine, from north of the
    White Mountains and from Sunapee Lake in New Hampshire, and in the Green Mountains
    south to central Vermont, New Brunswick and to Minnesota. Found also in Alaska and
    Greenland. This much-coveted fern has a singularly sweet and lasting fragrance,
    compared by some to strawberries, by others to new-mown hay and sweet brier leaves.
    We have seen herbarium specimens that were mildly and pleasantly odorous after
    several years. When growing the fern may be tested "by its fragrance, its stickiness
    and its beautiful brown curls." Evergreen. Spores ripen the middle of August.</p>

    <br />
    <br />
     <p>The ferns of this group, not counting the small fragrant fern, prefer the woods or
    at least shady places. Although the genus <i>Pol&yacute;stichum</i> represents the true
    shield ferns, the wood ferns are also thus designated, as their indusia have nearly
    the shape of small, roundish shields. The old generic name for them all was
    <i>Asp&iacute;dium</i> (meaning shield), first published in 1800. For a long time its chief
    rival was <i>Nephr&ograve;dium</i> (kidney-like), 1803. Many modern botanists have preferred
    the earlier name <i>Dry&oacute;pteris</i> (1763), meaning oak fern, alluding, perhaps, to
    its forest-loving habits. THEL&Yacute;PTERIS, still earlier (1762), may supersede the
    others.</p>

    <h4>(1) MARGINAL SHIELD FERN, EVERGREEN WOOD FERN</h4>
    <h4><i>Asp&iacute;dium margin&agrave;le</i>. THEL&Yacute;PTERIS MARGIN&Agrave;LIS</h4>
    <h4><i>Dry&oacute;pteris margin&agrave;lis. Nephr&ograve;dium margin&agrave;le</i></h4>
		<br />
    <p>Fronds from a few inches to three feet long, ovate-oblong, somewhat leathery,
    smooth, twice pinnate. Pinn&aelig; lanceolate, acuminate, broadest just above the base.
    Pinnules oblong, often slightly falcate, entire or toothed. Fruit-dots large, round,
    close to the margin. Rocky hillsides in rich woods, rather common throughout our
    area. The heavy rootstock rises slightly above the ground and is clothed at the crown
    with shaggy, brown scales. Its rising caudex, often creeping for several inches over
    bare rocks, suggests the habit of a tree fern. In early spring it sends up a graceful
    circle of large, handsome, bluish-green blades. The stipes are short and densely
    chaffy. No other wood fern endures the winter so well. The fronds burdened with snow
    lop over among the withered leaves and continue green until the new ones shoot up in
    the spring. It is the most valuable of all the wood ferns for cultivation.</p>
    <h4>(2) THE MALE FERN</h4>
    <h4><i>Asp&iacute;dium F&igrave;lix-mas</i>. THEL&Yacute;PTERIS F&Igrave;LIX-MAS</h4>
    <h4><i>Dry&oacute;pteris F&igrave;lix-mas. Nephr&ograve;dium F&igrave;lix-mas</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds lanceolate, pinnate, one to three feet high growing in a crown from a
    shaggy rootstock. Pinn&aelig; lanceolate, tapering from base to apex. Pinnules oblong,
    obtuse, serrate at the apex, obscurely so at the sides, the basal incisely lobed,
    distant, the upper confluent. Fruit-dots large, nearer the mid vein than the margin,
    mostly on the lower half of each fertile segment.</p>
    <p>The male fern resembles the marginal shield fern in outline, but the fronds are
    thinner, are not evergreen, and the sori are near the midvein. Its use in medicine is
    of long standing. Its rootstock produces the well-known <i>f&igrave;lix-mas</i> of the
    pharmacist. This has tonic and astringent properties, but is mainly prescribed as a
    vermifuge, which is one of the names given to it. In Europe it is regarded as the
    typical fern, being oftener mentioned and figured than any other. In rocky woods,
    Canada, Northfield, Vt., and northwest to the great lakes, also in many parts of the
    world.</p>

    <h4><i>Aspidium Goldi&agrave;num</i>. THELYPTERIS GOLDI&Agrave;NA</h4>

    <p>Fronds two to four feet high and often one foot broad, pinnate, broadly ovate,
    especially the sterile ones. Pinn&aelig; deeply pinnatifid, broadest in the middle. The
    divisions (eighteen or twenty pairs) oblong-linear, slightly toothed. Fruit-dots very
    near the midvein. Indusium large, orbicular, with a deep, narrow sinus. Scales dark
    brown to nearly black with a peculiar silky lustre.</p>
    <p>A magnificent species, the tallest and largest of the wood ferns. It delights in
    rich woodlands where there is limestone. Its range is from Canada to Kentucky. While
    not common, there are numerous colonies in New England. It is reported from
    Fairfield, Me., Spencer and Mt. Toby, Mass., and frequently west of the Connecticut
    River. We have often admired a large and beautiful colony of it on the west side of
    Willoughby Mountain in Vermont. It is easily cultivated and adds grace and dignity to
    a fern garden.</p>

    <h4><i>Aspidium crist&agrave;tum</i>. THEL&Yacute;PTERIS CRIST&Agrave;TA</h4>
    <h4><i>Dryopteris crist&agrave;ta. Nephrodium crist&agrave;tum</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds one to two feet long, linear-oblong or lanceolate, pinnate, acute. Pinn&aelig;
    two to three inches long, broadest at the base, triangular-oblong, or the lowest
    triangular. Divisions oblong, obtuse, finely serrate or cut-toothed, those nearest
    the rachis sometimes separate. Fruit-dots large, round, half way between the midvein
    and the margin. Indusium smooth, naked, with a shallow sinus.</p>
    <p>The short sterile fronds, though spreading out gracefully, are conspicuous only in
    winter; while the fertile fronds, tall, narrow and erect, are found only in
    summer.</p>
    <p>It is one of our handsomest evergreen ferns and even the large sori, with their
    dark spore cases and white indusia, are very attractive. The fertile pinn&aelig; have a way
    of turning their faces upward toward the apex of the frond for more light. In moist
    land, Canada to Kentucky.</p>
    <p>Var. <i>Clintoni&agrave;num</i>. Clinton's Wood Fern. Resembles the type, but is in every
    way larger. Divisions eight to sixteen pairs. Fruit-dots near the midvein, the sides
    of the sinus often overlapping. South central Maine to New York and westward. "Rare
    in New England attaining its best development in western sections." (Dodge.) Mt.
    Toby, Mass., Hanover, N.H. July. Fine for cultivation.</p>

    <h4>CRESTED MARGINAL FERN</h4>
    <h4><i>Asp&iacute;dium crist&agrave;tum X margin&agrave;le</i></h4>
    <p>Both the crested fern and Clinton's fern appear to hybridize with the marginal
    shield fern with the result that the upper part of the frond is like <i>marginale</i>
    and the lower like <i>crist&agrave;tum</i>, including the veining and texture.</p>
    <p>This form was discovered by Raynal Dodge, verified by Margaret Slosson and
    described by Geo. E. Davenport, who had a small colony under cultivation in his fern
    garden at Medford, Mass., and to him the writer and other friends are indebted for
    specimens.</p>
    <p>Found occasionally throughout New England and New Jersey. Other supposed hybrids
    have been found between the marginal shield and the spinulose fern and its variety
    <i>interm&egrave;dium</i>, and with Goldie's fern; also between the crested fern, including
    Clinton's variety and each of the others mentioned; and, in fact, between almost all
    pairs of species of the wood ferns, although we do not think they have been
    positively verified. Still other species of ferns are known to hybridize more or
    less, as we saw in the case of Scott's spleenwort.</p>

    <h4>(5) BOOTT'S SHIELD FERN</h4>
    <h4><i>Aspidium Boottii</i>. THEL&Yacute;PTERIS BOOTTII</h4>
    <h4><i>Dryopteris Boottii. Nephrodium Boottii</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds one to three feet high, oblong-lanceolate, bipinnate, the upper pinn&aelig;
    lanceolate, the lower triangular with spinulose teeth. Sori in rows each side of the
    midvein, one to each tooth and often scattering on the lower pinules. Indusium large,
    minutely glandular, variable.</p>
    <p>This fern has been thought to be a hybrid between the crested and spinulose ferns,
    but is now regarded as distinct. Like the crested fern its fertile fronds wither in
    autumn, while its sterile blades remain green throughout the winter. It differs from
    it, however, by being twice pinnate below, and from the typical spinulose fern by its
    glandular indusium; but from the intermediate variety it is more difficult to
    separate it, as that also has indusiate glands. The collector needs to study
    authentic specimens and have in mind the type, with its rather long, narrow blade as
    an aid to the verbal description, and even then he will often find it an interesting
    puzzle. Shaded swamps throughout our area.</p>

    <h4><i>Dryopteris spinul&ograve;sa. Nephrodium spinul&ograve;sum</i></h4>
    <p>Stipes with a few pale brown deciduous scales. Fronds one to two and one-half feet
    long, ovate-lanceolate, twice pinnate. Pinn&aelig; oblique to the rachis, the lower ones
    broadly triangular, the upper ones elongated. Pinnules on the inferior side of the
    pinn&aelig; often elongated, especially the lower pair, the pinnule nearest the rachis
    being usually the longest, at least in the lowest pinn&aelig;. Pinnules variously cut into
    spinulose-toothed segments. Indusium smooth, without marginal glands.</p>
    <p>The common European type, but in this country far less common than its varieties.
    They all prefer rich, damp woods, and because of their graceful outline and
    spiny-toothed lobes are very attractive. They can be transplanted without great
    difficulty, and the fern garden depends upon them for its most effective
    lacework.</p>
    <p>Var. <i>interm&egrave;dium</i> has the scales of the stipe brown with darker center.
    Fronds ovate-oblong, often tripinnate. Pinn&aelig; spreading, oblong-lanceolate. Pinnules
    pinnately cleft, the oblong lobes spinulose-toothed at the apex. Margin of the
    indusium denticulate and beset with minute, stalked glands. In woods nearly
    everywhere--our most common form. Millions of fronds of this variety are gathered in
    our northern woods, placed in cold storage and sent to florists to be used in
    decorations.[A] As long as the roots are not disturbed the crop is renewed from year
    to year, and no great harm seems to result. Canada to Kentucky and westward.</p>

    and the maidenhair were introduced into Europe in 1628 by John Tradescant, the first
    from America.</p>
    <p>It delights in shaded ravines and dripping hillsides in limestone districts. While
    producing spores freely it seems to propagate its species mainly by bulblets, which,
    falling into a moist soil, at once send out a pair of growing roots, while a tiny
    frond starts to uncoil from the heart of the bulb. Mt. Toby, Mass., Willoughby
    Mountain, Vt., calcareous regions in Maine, and west of the Connecticut River,
    Newfoundland to Manitoba, Wisconsin and Iowa; south to northern Georgia, Alabama and
    Arkansas.</p>
    <h4>(2) THE COMMON BLADDER FERN</h4>
    <h4><i>Cystopteris fr&aacute;gilis. Filix fr&aacute;gilis</i></h4>
    <p>Stipe long and brittle. Fronds oblong-lanceolate, five to twelve inches long,
    twice pinnate, the pinn&aelig; often pinnatifid or cut-toothed, ovate-lanceolate, decurrent
    on the winged rachis. Indusium appearing acute at the free end. Very variable in the
    cutting of the pinnules.</p>
    <p>The fragile bladder fern, as it is often called, and which the name
    <i>fr&aacute;gilis</i> suggests, is the earliest to appear in the spring, and the first to
    disappear, as by the end of July it has discharged its spores and withered away.
    Often, however, a new crop springs up by the last of August, as if Nature were
    renewing her youth. In outline the fragile bladder fern suggests the blunt-lobed
    Woodsia, but in the latter the pinn&aelig; and pinnules are usually broader and blunter,
    and its indusium splits into jagged lobes. Rather common in damp, shady places where
    rocks abound. In one form or another, found nearly throughout the world though only
    on mountains in the tropics.</p>

    <h3><a
     id="woodsias"
     name="woodsias">THE WOODSIAS</a></h3>
    <p>Small, tufted, pinnately divided ferns. Fruit-dots borne on the back of simply
    forked, free veins. Indusium fixed beneath the sori, thin and often evanescent,
    either small and open, or early bursting at the top into irregular pieces or lobes.
    (Named for James Woods, an English botanist.)</p>
    <h4>(1) RUSTY WOODSIA. <i>Wo&oacute;dsia ilv&eacute;nsis</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds oblong-lanceolate, three to ten inches high, rather smooth above, thickly
    clothed underneath with rusty, bristle-like chaff. Pinnate, the pinn&aelig; crowded,
    sessile, cut into oblong segments. Fruit-dots near the margin often confluent at
    maturity. Indusium divided nearly in the center into slender hairs which are curled
    over the sporangia. Stipes jointed an inch or so above the rootstock.</p>

     alt="Rusty Woodsia" /></a>
    <p>[Illustration: Rusty Woodsia, <i>Woodsia ilvensis</i>]</p>
    <p>The rusty Woodsia is decidedly a rock-loving fern, and often grows on high cliffs
    exposed to the sun; its rootstock and fronds are covered with silver-white, hair-like
    scales, especially underneath. These scales turn brown in age, whence the name,
    rusty. As the short stipes separate at the joints from the rootstock, they leave at
    the base a thick stubble, which serves to identify the fern. Exposed rocks, Labrador
    to North Carolina and westward. Rather common in New England. Said to be very
    abundant on the trap rock hillocks about Little Falls, N.J., where it grows in dense
    tufts.</p>
    <h4>(2) NORTHERN WOODSIA. ALPINE WOODSIA</h4>
    <h4><i>Woodsia alp&igrave;na. Woodsia hyperb&ograve;rea</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds narrowly lanceolate, two to six inches long, smooth above, somewhat hairy
    beneath, pinnate. Pinn&aelig; triangular-ovate, obtuse, lobed, the lobes few and nearly
    entire. Fruit-dots rarely confluent. Indusium as in <i>Woodsia ilvensis</i>.</p>

    <p>[Illustration: Details of Northern Woodsia. <i>Woodsia alpina</i>]</p>
    <p>Thought by some botanists to be a smooth form of <i>Woodsia ilvensis</i>. It was
    discovered in the United States by Horace Mann, in 1863, at Willoughby Lake, Vt.
    Twenty years or more later it was collected by C.H. Peck in the Adirondacks, who
    supposed it to be <i>Woodsia</i> <i>glab&eacute;lla</i>. In 1897 it was rediscovered at
    Willoughby Lake by C.H. Pringle. New York, Vermont, Maine, and British America.

    <h4>(3) BLUNT-LOBED WOODSIA. <i>Woodsia obt&ugrave;sa</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds broadly lanceolate, ten to eighteen inches long, nearly twice pinnate,
    often minutely glandular. Pinn&aelig; rather remote, triangular-ovate or oblong, pinnately
    parted into obtuse, oblong, toothed segments. Veins forked. Fruit-dots on or near the
    margin of the lobes. Indusium conspicuous, at length splitting into several
    spreading, jagged lobes.</p>

     alt="Blunt-lobed Woodsia" /></a>
    <p>[Illustration: Blunt-lobed Woodsia. <i>Woodsia obtusa</i>]</p>
    <p>This is our most common species of Woodsia and it has a wider range than the
    others, extending from Maine and Nova Scotia to Georgia and westward. On rocky banks
    and cliffs. The sori of this species have a peculiar beauty on account of the
    star-shaped indusium, as it splits into fragments. Var. <i>ang&uacute;sta</i> is a form with
    very narrow fronds and pinn&aelig;. Highlands, New York. The type grows in Middlesex
    County, Mass., but is rare.</p>
    <h4>(4) SMOOTH WOODSIA. <i>Woodsia glab&eacute;lla</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds two to five inches high, very delicate, linear, pinnate. Pinn&aelig; remote at
    the base, roundish-ovate, very obtuse with a few crenate lobes. Stipes jointed,
    straw-colored. Hairs of the indusium few and minute.</p>

    <p>On moist, mossy, mostly calcareous rocks, northern New England, Mount Mansfield,
    Willoughby, and Bakersfield Ledge, Vt., Gorham, N.H., also Newfoundland, New York,
    and far to the northwest. Not very common. It differs from the alpine species by the
    absence of scales above the joint. As the name implies, the plant is smooth, except
    for the chaffy scales at or near the rootstock, which mark all the Woodsias, and many
    other ferns, and which serve as a protective covering against sudden changes in
    extremes of heat and cold.</p>
    <h4>(5) OREGON WOODSIA. <i>Wo&oacute;dsia oreg&agrave;na</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds two to ten inches high, smooth, bright green, glandular beneath, narrowly
    lance-oblong, bipinnatifid. Pinnse triangular-oblong, obtuse, pinnatifid. Segments
    ovate or oblong, obtuse, crenate, the teeth or margin nearly always reflexed.
    Indusium minute, concealed beneath the sorus, divided into a few beaded hairs.</p>
    <p>Like the obtuse Woodsia this fern has no joint near the base of the stipe, but is
    much smaller and has several points of difference. Limestone cliffs, Gasp&eacute; Peninsula,
    southern shore of Lake Superior, Colorado, Oregon to the northwest. Its eastern limit
    is northern Michigan.</p>
    <h4>(6) ROCKY MOUNTAIN WOODSIA. <i>Wo&oacute;dsia scopul&igrave;na</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds six to fifteen inches long [smooth], lanceolate, pinnatifid. Pinn&aelig;
    triangular-ovate, the lowest pair shortened. Under surface of the whole frond
    hispidulous with minute, white hairs and stalked glands. Indusium hidden beneath the
    sporangia, consisting mostly of a few hair-like divisions.</p>
    <p>In crevices of rocks, mountains of West Virginia, Gasp&eacute; Peninsula, Rocky
    Mountains, and westward to Oregon and California.</p>
    <h4>(7) CATHCART'S WOODSIA. <i>Woodsia Cathcarti&agrave;na</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds eight to twelve inches high, lanceolate, bipinnatifid, finely
    glandular-puberulent. Pinnse oblong; the lower distant segments oblong, denticulate,
    separated by wide sinuses.</p>
    <p>Rocky river banks, west Michigan to northeast Minnesota.</p>
    <h4>DENNSTA&Eacute;DTIA. <i>Dicks&ograve;nia</i></h4>
    <p>Fruit-dots small, globular, marginal, each on the apex of a vein or fork.
    Sporangia borne on an elevated, globular receptacle in a membranous, cup-shaped
    indusium which is open at the top.</p>

    <p>While <i>Dennsta&eacute;dtia</i> is the approved scientific name of this species, the
    name <i>Dicks&ograve;nia</i> has come to be used almost as commonly as hay scented fern or
    boulder fern. It is one of our most graceful and delicate species, its long-tapering
    outline suggesting the bulblet bladder fern. It delights to cluster around rocks and
    boulders in upland fields and pastures and in the margin of rocky woods. It is
    sweet-scented in drying. A fine species for the fernery and one of the most
    decorative of the entire fern family. The effect of the shimmering fronds, so
    delicately wrought, flanked by evergreens, is highly artistic. Fine-haired mountain
    fern, pasture fern, and hairy <i>Dicks&ograve;nia</i> are other names. Canada to Tennessee
    and westward.</p>
    <p>Var. <i>cristata</i> has the fronds more or less forked at the top.</p>

    <p>(Last three names applied to Ostrich Fern only.)</p>
    <p>It is a question whether the sensitive and ostrich fern should be included in the
    same genus. They are similar in many respects, but not in all. The sensitive fern has
    a running rootstock, scattered fronds, and netted veins; while the ostrich fern has
    an upright rootstock, fronds in crowns, and free veins.</p>

    Form]</p>
    <h4>(1) SENSITIVE FERN. <i>Onocl&egrave;a sens&iacute;bilis</i></h4>
    <p>Fronds one to three feet high, scattered along a creeping rootstock, broadly
    triangular, deeply pinnatifid, with segments sinuately lobed or nearly entire. Veins
    reticulated with fine meshes. The fertile fronds shorter, closely bipinnate with the
    pinnules rolled up into berry-like structures which contain the spore cases. (The
    name in Greek means a closed vessel, in allusion to the berry-like fertile segments.)
    The sensitive fern is so called from its being very sensitive to frost. The sterile
    and fertile fronds are totally unlike, the latter not coming out of the ground until
    about July, when they appear like rows of small, green grapes or berries, but soon
    turn dark and remain erect all winter, and often do not discharge their spores until
    the following spring. The little berry-like structures of the fertile frond represent
    pinnules, bearing fruit-dots, around which they are closely rolled. As Waters
    remarks, "Most ferns hold the sori in the open hand, but the sensitive fern grasps
    them tightly in the clenched fist."</p>
    <p>Var. <i>obtusilobat&agrave;</i> is an abortive form with the fertile segments only
    partially developed. The illustration shows several intermediate forms.</p>

    <p>The rootstocks send out slender, underground stolons which bear fronds the next
    year. Sterile fronds appear throughout the summer, fertile ones in July. Seen from a
    distance its graceful leaf-crowns resemble those of the cinnamon fern. An
    intermediate form between the fertile and sterile fronds is sometimes found, as in
    the sensitive fern. This handsome species thrives under cultivation. For grace and
    dignity it is unrivaled, and for aggressiveness it is, perhaps, equaled only by the
    lady fern. For the climax of beauty it should be combined with the maidenhair. The
    ostrich fern is fairly common in alluvial soil over the United States and Canada.</p>

    <h3><i>OSMUND&Agrave;CEAE</i></h3>
    <p>This family is represented in North America by three species, all of which belong
    to the single genus.</p>
    <h4>OSM&Uacute;NDA</h4>
    <p>The <i>osmundas</i> are tall swamp ferns growing in large crowns from strong,
    thickened rootstocks; the fruiting portion of the fertile frond much contracted and
    quite unlike the sterile. Sporangia large, globular, short-stalked, borne on the
    margin of the divisions and opening into two valves by a longitudinal slit. Ring
    obscure. (From Osmunder, a name of the god Thor.)</p>
    <h4>(1) FLOWERING FERN, ROYAL FERN</h4>
    <h4><i>Osm&uacute;nda reg&agrave;lis. Osmunda reg&agrave;lis</i>, var. SPECT&Agrave;BILIS</h4>
    <p>Fronds pale green, one to six feet high; sterile part bipinnate, each pinna having
    numerous pairs of lance-oblong, serrulate pinnules alternate along the midrib.
    Fruiting panicle of the frond six to twelve inches long, brown when mature and
    sometimes leafy.</p>
    <p>A magnificent fern, universally admired. Well named by the great Linn&aelig;us,
    <i>regalis</i>, royal, indeed, in its type of queenly beauty. The wine-colored stipes
    of the uncoiling fronds shooting up in early spring, lifting gracefully their pink
    pinn&aelig; and pretty panicles of bright green spore cases, throw an indescribable charm
    over the meadows and clothe even the wet, stagnant swamps with beauty nor is the
    attraction less when the showy fronds expand in summer and the green sporangia are
    turned to brown. The stout rootstocks are often erect, rising several inches to a
    foot above the ground, as if in imitation of a tree fern. The poet Wordworth hints at
    somewhat different origin of the name from that given here.</p>

   So stately of the Queen Osmanda named."

    <h4>(2) INTERRUPTED FERN. CLAYTON'S FERN</h4>
    <h4>Osmunda Claytoni&agrave;na</h4>
    <p>Fronds pinnate, one to five feet high. Pinn&aelig; cut into oblong, obtuse lobes.
    Fertile fronds taller than the sterile, having from one to five pairs of intermediate
    pinn&aelig; contracted and bearing sporangia.</p>

     alt="Interrupted Fern" /></a>
    <p>[Illustration: Interrupted Fern. <i>Osmunda Claytoni&agrave;na</i>]</p>
    <p>The fronds have a bluish-green tint; they mature their spores about the last of
    May. The sterile fronds may be distinguished from those of the cinnamon fern by not
    having retained, like those, a tuft of wool at the base of each pinna. Besides, in
    Clayton's fern the fronds are broader, blunter and thinner in texture, and the
    segments more rounded; the fronds are also more inclined to curve outwards. They turn
    yellow in the fall, at times "flooding the woods with golden light," but soon smitten
    by the early frosts they wither and disappear. The interrupted fern is rather common
    in damp, rocky woods and pastures; Newfoundland to Minnesota, south to North Carolina
    and Missouri. Although fond of moisture it is easily cultivated and its graceful
    outlines make it worthy of a prominent place in the fern garden. Var. <i>dubia</i>
    has the pinnules of the sterile frond widely separated, and the upper-middle ones
    much elongated. Southern Vermont.</p>

    <p>Each fertile frond springs up at first outside the sterile ones, but is soon
    surrounded and overtopped by them and finds itself in the center of a charming circle
    of green leaves curving gracefully outwards. In a short time, however, it withers and
    hangs down or falls to the ground. The large, conspicuous clusters of cinnamon ferns
    give picturesqueness to many a moist, hillside pasture and swampy woodyard. In its
    crosier stage it is wrapped in wool, which falls away as the fronds expand, but
    leaves, at the base of each pinna, a tiny tuft, as if to mark its identity.</p>

    <p>Many people in the country call the cinnamon fern the "buckhorn brake," and eat
    with relish the tender part which they find deep within the crown at the base of the
    unfolding fronds. This is known as the "heart of Osmund." The fern, itself, with its
    tall, recurving leaves makes a beautiful ornament for the shady lawn, and like the
    interrupted fern is easy to cultivate. The spores of all the <i>osmundas</i> are
    green, and need to germinate quickly or they lose their vitality. Common in low and
    swampy grounds in eastern North America and South America and Japan. May. Some think
    it was this species which was coupled with the serpent in the old rhyme,</p>

    <p>Fifty years ago this beautiful fern was more common than at present. There was a
    considerable colony in a low, alluvial meadow thicket at North Hadley, Mass., not far
    from Mt. Toby, where we collected it freely in 1872. Many used to decorate their
    homes with its handsome sprays, draping it gracefully over mirrors and pictures. It
    was known locally as the Hartford fern. Greedy spoilers ruthlessly robbed its
    colonies and it became scarce, at least in the Mt. Toby region. In Connecticut a law
    was enacted in 1867 for its protection and with good results. But as Mr. C.A.
    Weatherby states in the American Fern Journal (Vol. II, No. 4), the encroachments of
    tillage (mainly of tobacco, which likes the same soil), are forcing it from its
    cherished haunts, thus jeopardizing its survival. Doubtless an aggressive agriculture
    is in part responsible for its scarcity in the more northern locality. It is still
    found here and there in New England, New York and New Jersey; also in Kentucky,
    Tennessee and Florida, but is nowhere common. The fertile portion dies when the
    spores mature, but the sterile frondlets remain green through the winter. A handsome
    species for the fernery in the house or out of doors.</p>

    <p>EATON, DANIEL CADY. Born at Gratiot, Mich., September 12, 1834. His grandfather
    was Amos Eaton, noted botanist and author. Studied botany under his friend, Prof. Asa
    Gray, who had studied with Prof. John Torrey, who in turn was a pupil of Amos Eaton.
    Daniel C. was professor of botany in Yale College, for more than thirty years. A man
    of graceful and winsome personality, an authority on ferns, and widely known by his
    writings. His masterpiece was "The Ferns of North America" in two large, quarto
    volumes, beautifully illustrated. He died June 29, 1895.</p>
    <p>CLUTE, WILLARD NELSON. Born at Painted Post, N.Y., February 26, 1869. Education
    informal; common schools, university lectures and private study. Manifested early a
    keen interest in birds and flowers. Was founder and first president of the American
    Fern Society. Collected in Jamaica more than three hundred species of ferns. Has
    written extensively on the ferns and their allies, besides publishing several
    standard volumes. His great distinction is in founding and editing the <i>Fern
    Bulletin</i> through its twenty volumes, when he combined this publication with
    <i>The American Botanist</i>, which is now on its twenty-eighth volume, the whole a
    prodigious achievement of great scientific value.</p>

    DODGE]</p>
    <p>UNDERWOOD, LUCIUS MARCUS. Born at New Woodstock, N.Y., October 26, 1853. Spent
    early life on a farm. Was graduated from Syracuse University in 1877. After teaching
    several years in his alma mater and elsewhere, he became Professor of Botany in
    Columbia University. He contributed numerous articles to the <i>Torrey Bulletin</i>,
    <i>Fern Bulletin</i>, and other scientific journals. His scholarly book, "Our Native
    Ferns and Their Allies," continued unexcelled through six editions. He died November
    16, 1907.</p>
    <p>DAVENPORT, GEO. EDWARD. Born in Boston, August 3, 1833. A promoter and officer of
    the Middlesex Institute. An accurate and diligent student of the ferns, his numerous
    articles were published in the <i>Fern Bulletin</i>, in the <i>Torrey Bulletin</i>,
    <i>Rhodora</i>, and in separate monographs. He was a leading authority on the
    pteridophyta, and collected a large and choice herbarium of the native ferns, which
    he donated to the Massachusetts Horticultural Society. By his gentle manners and
    kindly spirit he won many friends, all of whom were proud to recognize his
    distinguished ability. He cultivated many of our rare native ferns in his Fellsway
    home, at Medford, Mass., and freely gave specimens to his friends. He died suddenly
    of heart failure, November 29, 1907.</p>
    <p>WATERS, CAMPBELL EASTER. Born in Baltimore County, Md., September 14, 1872. Was
    graduated at Johns Hopkins University in 1895. Ph.D. in 1899. Was for a time a close
    student of ferns, and issued his notable book, "Ferns," in 1903, containing his
    "Analytical Key Based on the Stipes." A chemist by profession, he has pursued that
    branch of science for the last eighteen years. His address is Bureau of Standards,
    Washington, D.C.</p>
    <p>MAXON, WILLIAM RALPH. Born at Oneida, N.Y., February 27, 1877. Was graduated at
    Syracuse University in 1898. Began as aid in cryptogamic botany, United States
    National Herbarium, 1899, and is now associate curator of the same. Has specialized
    in scientific work on the pteridophyta, distinguishing himself by the excellence as
    well as by the large number of his publications, the more important being "Studies of
    Tropical American Ferns," Nos. 1 to 6. The <i>Fern Bulletin</i>, <i>Torrey
    Bulletin</i>, <i>American Fern Journal</i>, <i>Fernwort Papers</i>, et al., have
    profited from his expert and up-to-date knowledge. He is president of the American
    Fern Society.</p>
    <p>PARSONS, FRANCES THEODORA. Born in New York, December 5, 1861. <i>N&eacute;e</i> Smith.
    Married Commander William Starr Dana of the United States Navy, who was lost at sea.
    As Mrs. Dana, she published, "How to Know the Wild Flowers," in 1893, and within ten
    years more than seventy thousand copies of the book had been sold. "According to
    Season" appeared in 1894. In February, 1896, she married Prof. James Russell Parsons,
    treasurer of the University of the State of New York. In 1899 she published, "How to
    Know the Ferns." She combined a thorough knowledge of her subject with an easy and
    graceful style.</p>
    <p>DODGE, RAYNAL. Born at Newburyport, Mass., September 9, 1844. Civil War veteran.
    Wounded at Port Hudson, June 28, 1863. A machinist by trade. A careful observer and
    student of nature, he discovered <i>Aspidium simulatum</i> at Follymill, Seabrook,
    N.H., in 1880. (Whittier's "My Playmate," verse 9.) He discovered also the hybrid
    <i>Aspidium cristatum &times; Marginale</i>. He published his little book, "Ferns and Fern
    Allies of New England," in 1896. Died October 20, 1918.</p>
    <p>EATON, ALVAH AUGUSTUS. Born at Seabrook, N.H., November 20, 1865. Studied at the
    Putnam School in Newburyport, but was largely self-educated. He took up teaching for
    several years, spending three years in California. Returning East, he became a
    florist and began to write for various fern journals, giving special attention to the
    fern allies. He prepared the genera <i>Equisetum</i> and <i>Isoetes</i> for the
    seventh edition of "Gray's Manual." He proved the keenness of his observing powers by
    discovering several ferns new to the United States. Died at his home in North Easton,
    Mass., September 29, 1908.</p>
    <p>WILLIAMSON, JOHN. Born in Abernathy, Scotland, about the year 1838. He came to
    Louisville, Ky., to live in 1866. A wood-carver by trade, he could work skillfully in
    wood or metal, and after a time established a brass foundry. His friend, George E.
    Davenport, writes of him: "He caught as by some divine gift or inspiration the
    innermost life and feelings of the wild flowers and ferns, and his marvelously
    accurate needle transfixed them with revivifying power on paper or metal." His "Ferns
    of Kentucky," issued in 1878, was the first handbook on ferns published in the United
    States. He died June 17, 1884, in the mountains of West Virginia, whither he had gone
    for his health.</p>

    <h4><a
     id="meaningof"
     name="meaningof">NOTE</a></h4>
    <p>The student should have some idea of the terms <i>genus</i>, <i>species</i> and
    <i>variety</i>, although they are not capable of exact definition.</p>
    <p>A <i>species</i>, or kind, is in botany the unit of classification. It embraces
    all such individuals as may have originated in a common stock. Such individuals bear
    an essential resemblance to each other, as well as to their common parent in all
    their parts. E.g., the Cinnamon fern is a kind or species of fern with the fronds
    evidently of one kind, and of a common origin, and all producing individuals of their
    own kind by their spores or rootstocks. When such individuals differ perceptibly from
    the type in the shape of the pinn&aelig;, or the cutting of the fronds, we have
    <i>varieties</i> as <i>frond&ograve;sum</i>, <i>inc&igrave;sum</i>, etc. Or if the difference is
    less striking the word <i>form</i> is used instead of variety, but in any given case
    opinions may differ in respect to the more fitting term.</p>
    <p>A <i>genus</i> is an assemblage of species closely related to each other, and
    having more points of resemblance than of difference; e.g., the royal fern, the
    cinnamon fern, and the interrupted fern are alike in having similar spore cases borne
    in a somewhat similar manner on the fronds, and forming the genus <i>Osmunda</i>. In
    like manner certain members of the clover group--red, white, yellow, etc., make up
    the genus <i>Trifolium</i>.</p>
    <p>Thus individuals are grouped into species and species are associated into genera,
    and the two groups are united to give each fern or plant its true name, the generic
    name being qualified by that of the species; as in the cinnamon fern <i>Osm&uacute;nda</i>
    (genus), <i>cinnam&ograve;mea</i> (species).</p>

THE PETRIFIED FERN

  In a valley, centuries ago,
  Grew a little fern-leaf green and slender,
  Veining delicate and fibers tender,
  Waving when the wind crept down so low;
  Rushes tall and moss and grass grew round it,
  Playful sunbeams darted in and found it,
  Drops of dew stole down by night and crowned it.
  But no foot of man e'er came that way--
  Earth was young and keeping holiday.

  Monster fishes swam the silent main,
  Stately forests waved their giant branches,
  Mountains hurled their snowy avalanches,
  Mammoth creatures stalked across the plain,
  Nature reveled in grand mysteries;
  But the little fern was not of these,
  Did not slumber with the hills and trees,
  Only grew and waved its wild, sweet way;
  No one came to note it day by day.

  Earth, one time, put on a frolic mood,
  Heaved the rocks and changed the mighty motion
  Of the deep, strong currents of the ocean;
  Moved the plain and shook the haughty wood,
  Crushed the little fern in soft, moist clay,
  Covered it and hid it safe away.
  Oh, the long, long centuries since that day!
  Oh, the changes! Oh, life's bitter cost!
  Since the useless little fern was lost.

  Useless? Lost? There came a thoughtful man
  Searching Nature's secrets far and deep;
  From a fissure in a rocky steep
  He withdrew a stone o'er which there ran
  Fairy pencilings, a quaint design,
  Leafage, veining, fibers clear and fine,
  And the fern's life lay in every line!
  So, I think, God hides some souls away,
  Sweetly to surprise us the last day!--M.B. BRANCH.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
